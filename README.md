It represents a fundamental learning experience and my very first attempt at building a web page.

## My Learning Journey

This project was an invaluable part of my early web development journey. It allowed me to grasp the foundational concepts of how web pages are structured and displayed in a browser. It stands as a testament to learning from scratch and building something tangible with newly acquired skills.
